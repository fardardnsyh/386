# Privacy Policy

I take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy. I provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

This website track basic information about its visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this website. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes, and is anonymised.

If used, the contact form will store the information you provide in order to respond to your query. This information will not be used for any other purpose and will be stored for up to 90 days.

You can request deletion of these contact form submissions at [https://jackbailey.dev/contact/remove](https://jackbailey.dev/contact/remove).


## Local storage

Where necessary, this website uses localstorage to store the visitor's preference of colour scheme, when the theme toggle is used. This is only stored locally and never leaves the visitor's browser.


## Links to Third Party Websites

I have included links on this website for your use and reference. I am not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from my own.


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of `2024-05-15` and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.
